iPhoneCoreDataRecipes for iOS 5

"iPhoneCoreDataRecipes" is a nice sample code for iOS learner, but it's for iOS4 now (1/2012)
You can find that here: http://developer.apple.com/library/iOS/#samplecode/iPhoneCoreDataRecipes/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40008913

I try to make a copy of that using iOS5 features, like:

Storyboard & Segques for UIs
UIManagedDocument for CoreData

Enjoy.
